javaScript allows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using classes and prototypes. Here are the key concepts:

Classes and Objects:

Classes are blueprints for creating objects with properties and methods.
Objects are instances of classes.
Encapsulation:

Restricts direct access to object properties.
Private properties can be created using # in ES6.
Use getters/setters to access private properties.
Inheritance:

One class can inherit properties and methods from another class using the extends keyword.
super() is used to call the parent class's constructor.
Polymorphism:

Subclasses can override methods of the parent class to provide specialized behavior.
Abstraction:

Hides complex details and exposes only necessary parts.
Simulated using method overriding and inheritance in JavaScript.
Static Methods:

Methods that belong to the class itself, not instances of the class.
Prototypes:

Every object in JavaScript has a prototype from which it can inherit methods and properties.
This combination of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction forms the basis of OOP in JavaScript.
